                    <h2>About Malnutrition</h2>
                    <h3>What is Micronutrient Malnutrition?</h3>
                        <p>Micronutrient malnutrition refers to diseases caused by a lack of essential vitamins or minerals required in small amounts by the body for proper growth and development. Micronutrient deficiencies affect more than 2 billion people today, most commonly in developing countries, although people in developed countries can still suffer from these nutritional problems. Critical micronutrients required by our bodies and linked to the prevention of serious diseases include Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Iron, Iodine, Vitamin B1 (thiamin), Vitamin K, and Calcium.</p>

                    <h3>Why is it an issue?</h3>
                        <p>Dietary deficiencies of vital vitamins and minerals can lead to many serious, lasting health issues. Micronutrient Malnutrition also negatively affects learning ability, productivity, and human potential. This is particularly devastating in developing countries, as it impedes socioeconomic development and leads to a spiral of underdevelopment in already underprivileged groups. Micronutrient malnutrition most prevalently affects children in areas with limited educational and economic resources, therefore it is critical for caretakers and educators to share resources on how to ensure proper micronutrient consumption.</p>

                    <h3>Where is it most prevalent?</h3> 
                        <p>Prevalence of serious micronutrient deficiencies is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, particularly for pregnant women and children. Data relating to deficiencies in the most affected underdeveloped areas is limited, due to the lack of resources and education relating to micronutrient malnutrition. </p>

                <h2>Vitamin A Deficiency</h2>
                <p>Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) primarily affects children and pregnant women. The deficiency tragically causes Nyctalopia, or night blindness, and, eventually, permanent blindness. Vitamin A deficiency is common in underdeveloped countries, and every year, a quarter to half a million children go permanently blind as a result of VAD. It also leads to stunted physical growth and impaired resistance to infections, causing higher fatality rates, even at mild subclinical deficiencies.</p> 
                <p>Factors that increase risk of the deficiency: low intakes of dairy products, eggs and B-carotene from fruits and vegetables, presence of helminth infection, ascaris</p> 
                <p>Vitamin A rich food: beef liver, oats, eggs, milk, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrot, cantaloupe, mango, spinach, broccoli, kale, collards, butternut squash</p> 
                <h2>Iron Deficiency</h2>
                <p>Iron deficiency is a problem across the globe, affecting more than 2 billion people. Anaemia in infants and children is associated with stunted physical growth, reduced resistance to infections and slow development of learning abilities. In adults it causes fatigue and reduced work capacity. Blood loss in childbirth is very dangerous for anaemic women and is the main cause of about 20 percent of maternal deaths. Maternal anaemia also leads to fetal growth retardation, low infant birth weight and increased perinatal mortality (death in the first week of life).</p> 
                <p>Factors that increase risk of the deficiency: low intakes of meat/fish/poultry, preterm delivery or low birth weight, pregnancy and adolescence, heavy menstrual losses, parasite infections, malaria, low intakes of Vitamin C, allergy to cowâ€™s milk</p>
                <p>Iron rich food: beef, spinach, potatoes, chicken, oysters, shrimp, tuna, raisins, prunes. kidney beans, chickpeas, lentils, tofu, cashews</p>
                <h2>Vitamin C Deficiency</h2>
                <p>Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is used by the human body to make collagen and repair body tissues. The human body cannot make Vitamin C on its own, so it is critical that enough Vitamin C is consumed through fruits, vegetables, or Vitamin C supplements. Over time, severe Vitamin C deficiency can lead to an illness known as scurvy, which is regularly reported in famine situations in suffering parts of Africa. Scurvy affects blood vessels, skin and tissue repair, which results in anemia, skin hemorrhaging, and gum disease.</p>
                <p>Factors that increase risk of the deficiency: low intakes of fresh vitamin c-rich fruits and vegetables, prolonged cooking, elderly adults, alcoholics</p>
                <p>Vitamin C rich foods: oranges, grapefruit, kiwi, strawberries, tomato, red pepper, potato</p>
                <h2>Vitamin B1 (thiamin) Deficiency</h2>
